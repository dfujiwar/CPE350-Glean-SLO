          years in the religious non-profit world, Ross loves to help people struggling on the margins.

          <p class="grey-text">Sally worked for twenty years as a registered dietitian, and daily saw the role of good nutrition
          in promoting health and preventing disease. She then become a school teacher for 17 years
          where her favorite position was teaching hands on science lab to fourth, fifth and sixth
          graders. Students were always amazed to understand that the human body is composed
          entirely from the food they ate and water. She moved to California from Cambridge,
          Massachusetts just weeks after getting married in 1980. She grew up in Connecticut and her
          family were avid gardeners. She was thrilled to garden every day of the year here and has
          always had fruit trees and a vegetable garden. Glean SLO’s mission to provide high quality
          fruits and vegetables to the 46,000 food insecure people in our county fits right in with her
          goals for raising a healthy society.</p>

          graduating with a BS in Natural Resources Management she moved to Washington state for
          ten years, returning to the central coast to raise her family. She taught elementary school in
          Atascadero until retiring in 2014. Being a long-time gardener and advocate for healthy eating,
          volunteering with GleanSLO was a perfect fit for her retirement time. She loves being able
          to help others by spending time outdoors harvesting fresh produce. She was immediately
          impressed by the sense of community and caring that GleanSLO and its volunteers represent,
          and is proud to be a part of this group.</p>

		  She was former GleanSLO Program Manager and also co-founded SLO Grown Kids, a local non-profit, to help promote school 
		  gardens. She loves photography and over the years has provided many photos for GleanSLO's newsletters, blog, Facebook and 
		  Flickr. She is proud to have helped create this gleaning program and loves that friendships have formed in fields, orchards,

          <p class="grey-text">Kylee is from Brawley, California, a small farming community in the furthest southeast corner of the state. 
		  Her connection to the land was established early in her childhood when her favorite pastime was doing field checks with her dad and 
		  "sampling" produce before harvest. Since high school, Kylee has lived all over California but has most recently moved back to the 
		  central coast after three years spent in Alaska. Kylee has a degree in Environmental Science from Humboldt State University (HSU) 
		  and her Masters in Public Policy (MPP '13) from Cal Poly. In 2016, Kylee and her husband Nick were lucky enough to move back to SLO 
		  County so she could take the role as Cal Poly's first Sustainability Coordinator. Throughout school and before her job at Cal Poly 
		  she worked with a variety of environmental non-profits including ECOSLO here locally. While she feels blessed to have established a 
		  career in sustainability, specifically as it relates to the university's resource management, her passion has always been in 
		  sustainable food systems. Her role on the Glean SLO steering committee is one fun way to continue working toward a more socially and 
		  environmentally just food web. When she is not working or gleaning, you can find her and her husband working on their house, on an 
		  adventure in the great outdoors, or growing, cooking, and preserving local bounty. She loves sharing her foodie skills and the fruits 
		  of her labor with her friends, family, and community.</p>

          <p class="grey-text">Ann Ketelaar grew up in Southern California. She moved to the Central Coast just over 20 years ago and loves it. 
		  She and her husband Dave raised their two teenage sons in Pismo Beach. After she transitioned away from full time work as a CPA to 
		  focus on her family, she began gleaning in 2015 and has completed over 100 gleans serving as both a gleaner and a glean leader. 
		  GleanSLO and the San Luis Obispo Food Bank allowed her to set an example for her family, showing them the importance of helping a 
		  worthy cause. Plants and gardening have always been an interest and hobby. Gleaning is a great opportunity to see firsthand what 
		  others have done with their gardens while helping people directly in our community. It has been an incredibly rewarding opportunity 
		  to meet people from all backgrounds and ages. In her spare time Ann also enjoys hiking with the family dog, rowing, doing Pilates and 
		  spending time with friends.</p>
